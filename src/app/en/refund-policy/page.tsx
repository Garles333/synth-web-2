          <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> January 1, 2025</p>
          <p><strong>Last Updated:</strong> January 1, 2025</p>

          <p><strong>1. Overview</strong></p>
          <p>
            This Refund Policy outlines the terms and conditions under which Inmutable 256 LLC 
            ("Synth", "we", "our", or "the Company") provides refunds for subscription services 
            purchased through our platform. By subscribing to our services, you agree to the terms 
            outlined in this policy.
          </p>

          <p><strong>2. Subscription Model</strong></p>
          <p>
            Synth operates on a subscription-based pricing model with the following characteristics:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Pay-Per-Participant:</strong> You are charged once when you integrate a synthetic participant into a simulation (interview or focus group).</li>
            <li><strong>24-Hour Unlimited Interaction Window:</strong> Once a simulation begins, you have 24 hours of unlimited dialogue with participants at no additional cost.</li>
            <li><strong>Free Preparation Tools:</strong> All preparation work (creating Personas, Stimuli, Moderation Guides, Knowledge Library uploads) is free and unlimited.</li>
          </ul>

          <p><strong>3. Free Trial Period</strong></p>
          <p>
            We offer a free trial period that allows new users to explore the platform and test features 
            before committing to a paid subscription. During the trial period:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>No credit card is required to start the trial</li>
            <li>You have full access to platform features as specified in your trial plan</li>
            <li>The trial automatically expires at the end of the trial period unless you choose to subscribe</li>
            <li>No charges are applied unless you explicitly upgrade to a paid plan</li>
          </ul>

          <p><strong>4. General Refund Policy</strong></p>
          
          <h3 className="mt-8 mb-4 text-xl font-medium text-white">4.1 No Refunds on Completed Sessions</h3>
          <p>
            Due to the nature of our service, which involves real-time AI processing and resource allocation, 
            <strong> we do not provide refunds for completed simulation sessions</strong>. Once a session has been 
            initiated and you have interacted with synthetic participants, the service has been delivered and 
            charges are final.
          </p>

          <h3 className="mt-8 mb-4 text-xl font-medium text-white">4.2 Technical Issues</h3>
          <p>
            If you experience technical problems that prevent you from using a paid session, please contact 
            our support team at <strong>hola@synth-insights.com</strong> immediately. We will:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Investigate the issue promptly</li>
            <li>Provide technical assistance to resolve the problem</li>
            <li>Consider refunds or credits on a case-by-case basis if the issue was caused by our platform</li>
          </ul>

          <h3 className="mt-8 mb-4 text-xl font-medium text-white">4.3 Billing Errors</h3>
          <p>
            If you believe you have been charged in error or notice any discrepancies in your billing, 
            contact us within <strong>30 days</strong> of the charge. We will:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Review your account and transaction history</li>
            <li>Correct any confirmed billing errors</li>
            <li>Issue refunds for unauthorized or duplicate charges</li>
          </ul>

          <p><strong>5. Subscription Cancellation</strong></p>
          
          <h3 className="mt-8 mb-4 text-xl font-medium text-white">5.1 Cancellation Process</h3>
          <p>
            You may cancel your subscription at any time through your account dashboard. Cancellations 
            are effective at the end of your current billing period, and you will retain access to paid 
            features until that date.
          </p>

          <h3 className="mt-8 mb-4 text-xl font-medium text-white">5.2 No Partial Refunds</h3>
          <p>
            When you cancel your subscription, <strong>no partial refunds will be issued</strong> for the 
            remaining days in your billing cycle. You will continue to have access to the service until 
            the end of the paid period.
          </p>

          <h3 className="mt-8 mb-4 text-xl font-medium text-white">5.3 Unused Credits</h3>
          <p>
            Any unused participant credits or session allowances at the time of cancellation will expire 
            at the end of your billing period and are non-refundable.
          </p>

          <p><strong>6. Exceptional Circumstances</strong></p>
          <p>
            We understand that exceptional situations may arise. Refund requests outside the standard 
            policy will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis at our sole discretion. Circumstances that
